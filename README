This is a lightweight blogging app built on top of web.py.

It uses Dropbox as a filestore to sync flat files, which will serve as
the backend. This gives the user full control over the backend from
anywhere.

Upon login, the user will be prompted to log in to dropbox and then to
select a folder to use as the directory to store all posts.

Posts are stored in directory split by date, in the form
YYYY/MM/DD. Files can be stored in either Markdown or HTML format.
